## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Separation
```typescript
// User/Buyer scope
import { apiClient, queryKeys } from "@/lib/api";
const { data: orders } = useQuery({
  queryKey: queryKeys.user.orders,
  queryFn: () => apiClient.getOrders(),
});

// Seller scope
import { sellerApiClient, sellerQueryKeys } from "@/lib/sellerApi";
const { data: products } = useQuery({
  queryKey: sellerQueryKeys.products(),
  queryFn: () => sellerApiClient.getProducts(),
});
```

### Query Keys Convention
```typescript
// User-scoped
["user:orders"]
["user:wallet"]
["user:wishlist"]
["user:kyc"]

// Seller-scoped
["seller:dashboard"]
["seller:products"]
["seller:orders"]
["seller:payouts"]
```

### Loading States
```typescript
if (isLoading) {
  return <OverviewTabSkeleton />;
}
```

### Empty States with CTAs
```typescript
<EmptyState
  icon={ShoppingBag}
  title="No Orders Yet"
  description="Start shopping to see your orders here."
  action={{
    label: "Browse Products",
    href: "/products"
  }}
/>
```
